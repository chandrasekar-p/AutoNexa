# AutoNexa API — Phase 2: Auth, Multi-Tenancy, Roles & Permissions

This is the Phase 2 slice of the AutoNexa backend: everything every later
phase (customers, job cards, inventory, billing…) will build on top of.

## What's in this phase

- **Multi-tenant data isolation** — `PrismaService.forTenant()` + an
  AsyncLocalStorage-based `TenantContext` auto-injects/filters `tenantId`
  on every tenant-scoped query. Services never pass `tenantId` by hand.
- **Auth** — JWT access tokens (15 min default) + rotating refresh tokens
  (30 days default, httpOnly cookie), argon2 password hashing, reuse
  detection (a replayed, already-rotated refresh token revokes its whole
  token family).
- **RBAC** — global `resource:action` permission catalogue, tenant-owned
  roles that compose permissions, `@Permissions(...)` decorator + guard
  enforced server-side on every route.
- **Tenant provisioning** — Super Admin-only endpoint that creates a new
  workshop tenant with its default settings, all 7 default roles (from the
  Phase 1 matrix), and its first Workshop Owner user, in one transaction.
- **Audit logging** — `@Audit(action, entity)` decorator + interceptor
  writes an `AuditLog` row after mutating routes succeed.

## Modules

`auth`, `tenants`, `branches`, `users`, `roles`, `permissions`

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — at minimum set DATABASE_URL to a real Postgres instance
# and change JWT_ACCESS_SECRET / JWT_REFRESH_SECRET / SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD

npm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name phase2_auth_tenancy_rbac
npm run prisma:seed
npm run start:dev
```

API docs: `http://localhost:4000/api/docs`

## Try it

```bash
# Log in as the seeded demo Workshop Owner
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tenantSlug":"demo-workshop","email":"owner@demoworkshop.test","password":"ChangeMe123!"}'

# Use the returned accessToken
curl http://localhost:4000/branches \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>"
```

## Notes on this codebase

- **`prisma generate` requires network access** to `binaries.prisma.sh` to
  download the query engine. If you're behind a restrictive proxy/firewall,
  see Prisma's docs on custom engine binary targets or offline install.
- **Type-checked** with `npx tsc --noEmit` against a real generated Prisma
  client — if you added/changed schema, re-run `npx prisma generate` before
  `tsc` or your IDE will show stale types.
- **`PrismaService.forTenant()` enforcement list** (`TENANT_SCOPED_MODELS`
  in `src/prisma/prisma.service.ts`) must be extended every time a new
  tenant-owned model is added in a later phase — this is the single most
  important file to keep in sync with `schema.prisma`.
- The demo tenant's login is `owner@demoworkshop.test` / `ChangeMe123!` —
  seeded for local development only; never ships to a real deployment.

## What's deliberately NOT in this phase

Customers, vehicles, appointments, job cards, inventory, billing — these
land in Phases 3–7 per the sequencing in the Phase 1 architecture doc, each
building on the auth/tenancy/RBAC foundation laid here.
